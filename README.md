## Welcome

[Ember guides](https://github.com/randito/ember_guide) is a project for
learning Ember.js by reimplementing the [Getting Started
Guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started/) in Coffeescript.

[This project](https://github.com/randito/ember_guide_slides) are some slides
for this project.  These slides were used for a work presentation: "Ember
101."

### Reveal.js

These slides use the fantastic [reveal.js
library](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).
