## Welcome

[Ember guides](https://github.com/randito/ember_guide) is a project for
learning Ember.js by reimplementing the [Getting Started
Guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started/) in Coffeescript.

[This project](https://github.com/randito/ember_guide_slides) are some slides
for this project.  These slides were used for a work presentation: "Ember
101."

**Disclaimer:**  These slides are not a definitive guide or source for
Ember.js or Coffeescript.  They are just my presentation notes to guide my
developer lunch presentation.

### Reveal.js

This project is based on the fantastic [reveal.js
library](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

The arrow keys used for navigation are current hidden; use the left and right
arrow to navigate the slides.
